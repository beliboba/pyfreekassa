## How to add docs
### If you are adding a new feature, you should add documentation for it. 
1. You can use .md files instead of .rst files since `myst-parser is used`.
2. Make sure to test your docs locally before pushing them.
3. Make sure to add your docs to `./docs` folder.
4. Make sure to add your page in `./docs/index.rst`.
